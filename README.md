# Hello folks!
Thank you for reading this!

## What am I up to right now?
I work at [Ridepanda](https://www.ridepanda.com/), coding on Ruby (Rails) & React (Typescript/NextJS).

## Previous jobs
[Emeritus](https://emeritus.org/) and [Shipit](https://www.shipit.cl/).

## About me
I enjoy chatting about all things tech, D&D adventures, sharing (hopefully cool, mostly random) facts, and getting lost in novels -especially fantasy and Wuxia!-.

Feel free to hit me up at [zamiz@zeaneth.com](mailto:zamiz@zeaneth.com) with any projects/topics or feedback on what you see over here or on [twitter/x](https://twitter.com/ZamizTo).
