# Hello folks!
I'm a newbie in just about everything, so first thank you for giving this a read!

I work at [Ridepanda](https://www.ridepanda.com/), mainly coding on Ruby on Rails and React.

Previously at [Emeritus](https://emeritus.org/) and [Shipit](https://www.shipit.cl/), working with Ruby on Rails and React.

And outside work I'm having fun learning Swift.

I love talking about tech, procrastination, coffee, and Wuxia novels, so feel free to hit me up at [zamiz@zeaneth.com](mailto:zamiz@zeaneth.com) with any topics or feedback on what you see over here or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ZamizTo).
