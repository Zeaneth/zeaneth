# Hello folks!
I'm a newbie in just about everything, so first thank you for giving this a read!

I work at [Shipit](https://www.shipit.cl/) mainly coding on Ruby on Rails, some front with React using Next.js, and I'm having fun with Swift.

I love talking about tech, procrastination and coffee, so feel free to hit me up at [zamiz@zeaneth.com](mailto:zamiz@zeaneth.com) with any topics or feedback on what you see over here or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ZamizTo).
